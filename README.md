# Global Components repository

I often had to re-use base components in my projects. Here is a collection of base components to import in your projects.

## Storybook

To see instances of these components and documentation, you can go to https://golbal-components-docs.web.app
On the top-(almost)right of the screen you will see a `Docs` button. Press on it.
You will now see the component and it's documentation. You can even see the code used to show this component by clicking the `Show code` button on the bottom left of the component's display box.

## Base Display Components

These components will display a type. For the `Delegate` component, it can be passed any type from the other base display components. Here is a list of all the Base display components:

- `ArrayInstance`
- `BooleanInstance`
- `DateInstance`
- `NumberInstance`
- `ObjectInstance` (JSON-type object)
- `StringInstance`
- `Delegate`

## Base Input Component

These components will create an input for the dictated type. The `Form` component will generate a form from inputted data. Here is a list of all the Base Input components:
