# Global Components repository

I often had to re-use base components in my projects. Here is a collection of base components to import in your projects.

## Base Display Components

These components will display a type. For the `Delegate` component, it can be passed any type from the other base display components. Here is a list of all the Base display components:

- `ArrayInstance`
- `BooleanInstance`
- `DateInstance`
- `NumberInstance`
- `ObjectInstance` (JSON-type object)
- `StringInstance`
- `Delegate`

## Base Input Component

These components will create an input for the dictated type. The `Form` component will generate a form from inputted data. Here is a list of all the Base Input components:

- `BooleanInstance`
- `DateInstance`
- `EmailInstance`
- `NumberInstance`
- `PasswordInstance`
- `SelectInstance`
- `StringInstance`
- `FormInstance`

## Other Components

Here is a list of other components that are included in this library:

- `Button`
- `Spacer`
